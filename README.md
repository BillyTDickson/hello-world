GitHub Repository tutorial

G'day GitHubbers, 
I'm an electrician in Australia, now studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Mechatronic), looking for more knowledge and experience with software/coding/programming/being awesome. 
also signed up to Git Hub to ask question about a new calculator (nspire CX CAS) and running nPDF :(... had no idea how to get a library onto it 
look forward to learning from everyone on here!
